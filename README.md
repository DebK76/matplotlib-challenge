Storytelling and Data Visualization using Matplotlib methods 
This project showecases data analytics techniques using Pandas, Matplotlib and Python.
I was given two datasets for this analysis: Mouse Metadata, and Study Results
I combined the data into a single dataframe to preview and clean the data before I started working with it
Once all the duplicates were filtered and dropped
I began to parse my data using various methods beginning with a summary statistic table to show the (mean, median, variance, standard deviation and the SEM) of the tumor volume to aggregate the data to display the results of each of the drug regimen statss
Once that was completed I used other methods such as bar & pie chart, box plot, and scatter plots using pandas and pyplot to visualize the distribution of the data.
Lastly, concluding whether any of the particular drug regimen had any positive correlation on tumor growth, survival rates and metastatic sites in mice.
